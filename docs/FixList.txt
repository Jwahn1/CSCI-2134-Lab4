*********** ADD AS MANY MORE AS NEEDED *******************

ANALYSIS:

1. Compute how long it took you to complete all the bug fixes and the average time per bug fix.

Total time: 30 minutes
Number of bugs: 6 found
Average time per bug fix: 5 minutes

2. What was the hardest bug you fixed and what made it hard to fix?

getElem() bug was messing up a lot of the other function values so debugging was confusing until I tried fixing it,
it made fixing the negate() function harder as I kept trying to fix it thinking it was independent.

3. How consistent was your time to fix each bug? What factors may have affected that consistency?

my time is pretty consistent at 5 minutes or less, what may have affected it was that i was looking for common errors
like off by-one-errors or miss-inputted i's where j's should be.
